                    For air travel, please note that flight schedules

                    Overbooking: Practiced by all airlines,
                    overbooking consists of registering a number of reservations greater than the number
                    of available seats. We strongly recommend that you strictly respect the meeting time
                    because overbooking mainly concerns the last people arriving at check-in, and that
                    you refuse any volunteering to delay your departure so as not to spoil your first
                    days of the tour. All costs incurred to join the group in the event of non-boarding
                    due to overbooking will be at your sole expense.
