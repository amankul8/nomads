Some countries offer visa-free travel for short stays, while others may require an e-visa or visa-on-arrival. Ensure your passport is valid for at least six months beyond your travel dates, as many countries enforce this rule strictly. If you need a visa, gather all required documents, such as proof of accommodation, return flight tickets, and financial stability. Apply well in advance to avoid last-minute delays. For visa-on-arrival, confirm the process and prepare necessary fees in the local currency. Always double-check entry requirements on the official government website or consult the nearest embassy to avoid any surprises at immigration.",
